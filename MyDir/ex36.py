# Designing and debugging and small game project. 

# Some quick rules regarding for and while loops:


### IF STATEMENTS ###
    # every 'if' statement needs a 'else' statement, if the else is just meant to not 
    # do anything, call a function that will end the program such as dead() in ex35.py


    # Try not to put an if statement in another if statement, if that happens use a function
    # instead.
 
    # Treat if statements like paragraphs formatting wise. That includes elif, and else

    # Your boolean test should be simple.


### LOOPS ###
    # Use while loops only if you want something to run forever.
    # For loops should be used for everything else, especially if there is 
    # a fixed or limited number of things to loop over.
